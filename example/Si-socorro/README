This is an example for the Socorro interface.

To create supercells with displacements:

% phonopy --socorro -c unitcell.in -d --dim="2 2 2"

A perfect 2x2x2 supercell (supercell.in) and one 2x2x2 supercell
(supercell-xxx.in) of the conventional unit cell written in unitcell.in
are created. In addition, the disp.yaml file is created. After the force
calculation with the crystal structure in supercell-001.in, it is
necessary to create the FORCE_SETS file with

% phonopy --socorro -f diaryf

Here the diaryf file is the output of the Socorro calculation and is
supposed to contain the forces on atoms calculated by Socorro (make sure 
forces are on in the argvf file). The disp.yaml file has to be in the 
current directory. Now you can run a phonon calculation, e.g.,

% phonopy --socorro -c unitcell.in -p --dim="2 2 2" --pa="0 1/2 1/2 1/2 0 1/2 1/2 1/2 0" --band="1/2 1/2 1/2 0 0 0 1/2 0 1/2"
